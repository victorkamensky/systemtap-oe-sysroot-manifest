Overview
--------

Setup arranged by this repo manifest could be used to test set of systemtap
--sysroot option related fixes. In systemtap --sysroot option should be used
when stap compiler is used in cross compilation mode. I.e stap works on
host against target sysroot, and other target artifacts residing on host
and produces SystemTap compiled module, which needs to be copied to a target
and activated there with staprun utility.

Openembedded (OE) is great cross compiling environment that supports
several qemu based virtual targets with range of different CPU types. So
it should be very good for testing SystemTap --sysroot option. And eventually
it will be great if OE would absorb SystemTap --sysroot based operational
mode and make it easy to use.

Further instructions describe steps how systemtap with --sysroot capabilities
could be used in OE environment. Below instructions should generally
complete, if not there are a lot of great resources about OE on the net.

Build
-----

We use repo to organize openembedded-core and bitbake components into required
build environment.

o pull systemtap-oe-sysroot repo:

mkdir systemtap-oe-sysroot
cd systemtap-oe-sysroot
repo init -u https://github.com/victorkamensky/systemtap-oe-sysroot-manifest.git
repo sync

o run openembedded-core setup script:

source ./openembedded-core/oe-init-build-env

o configure any other OE build parameters in resulting conf/local.conf
as needed. I.e one may change DL_DIR location to your sources directory if
you have any. This step is optional.

o build core-image-minimal image. This step will take time, it builds small
but full Linux distro:

bitbake core-image-minimal

o build systemtap-native package, this build systemtap as host tool:

bitbake systemtap-native

o note you can edit conf/local.conf MACHINE setting and choose machine
with another CPU type like qemuarm, qemumips64, etc and repeat all
steps for another MACHINE type.

Run
---

o drop into openembedded-core environment as usual

source ./openembedded-core/oe-init-build-env

o start qemu through runqemu oe command, it should start your target linux
under qemu

runqemu

o in another terminal drop into openembedded-core environment again

source ./openembedded-core/oe-init-build-env

o change directory to directory with your SystemTap scripts

cd yourscriptsdir

o compile systemtap script, if you choose another oe image change -i option
properly

crosstap2 -s yourscript.stp -i core-image-minimal

during above step yourscript.ko module should be created

o copy yourscript.ko to target that runs in qemu, if you image does
not have ssh server you can copy yourscript.ko by some other means i.e
with tftp command.

scp yourscript.ko root@192.168.7.2:~

o ssh into target

ssh root@192.168.7.2

o activate script with staprun command, observe script in action, stop script
with Ctrl-C command when done

staprun yourscript.ko

o if you would like to pass additional options to stap compile pass them
to crosstap2 after -- argument. For example

crosstap2 -s yourscript.stp -i core-image-minimal -- -v

o if target available through ssh, and in this setup it should, you can
use --remote option to down load and start script right from crosstap2
script.

crosstap2 -s yourscript.stp -i core-image-minimal --remote root@192.168.7.2 -- -v

Example
-------

Find more example in EXAMPLES file alongside of this file.

Here is example with simple function tracing in mkdir. But
in core-image-minimal mkdir command is  symbolic link to
busybox.nosuid, so all busybox based commands will be traced
as result.

After script started to run, something was typed on console so
some busybox related (sh) execution got triggered

kamensky@kamensky-w541:/wd6/oe/20180304/systemtap-oe-sysroot/systemtap$ cat mkdir_func.stp
# trace all function from mkdir executable; in case
# of core-image-minimal mkdir is /bin/busybox.nosuid
# i.e all function in busybox will be traced

probe process("mkdir").function("*").call {
  printf ("%s -> %s\n", thread_indent(1), ppfunc())
}
probe process("mkdir").function("*").return {
  printf ("%s <- %s\n", thread_indent(-1), ppfunc())
}
kamensky@kamensky-w541:/wd6/oe/20180304/systemtap-oe-sysroot/systemtap$ crosstap2 -s mkdir_func.stp -i core-image-minimal --remote root@192.168.7.2 -- -v

    posted on linux-yocto as

    https://lists.yoctoproject.org/pipermail/linux-yocto/2018-March/006937.html

    Otherwise compiled kernel would not have DWARF symbols information

5937d06 systemtap: supports mips starting with version 3.1

    Enable systemtap on mips. Current openembedded information about mips support
    is obsolete. Posted on openembedded-core@lists.openembedded.org as

4ea1e1f Revert "systemtap: Cross compilation fix"

    openembedded-core had some quick fix to access kernel build tree. The fix is not
    needed. It is superseded by proposed systemtap --sysroot patches that follow.

f53d95d systemtap: support --sysroot option in variety of situations in cross build

    Set of systemtap --sysroot support fixes. Which is essential to run proposed
    functionality.

a1c90c6 image: add IMAGE_GEN_COMBINED_DEBUGFS build option

    Fix in openembedded-core to support build option that creates target sysroot
    overlayed with user land debug symbols. There is already IMAGE_GEN_DEBUGFS
    but that one creates two separate tarballs, target and debug symbols, that
    need to be recombined manually. IMAGE_GEN_COMBINED_DEBUGFS provides more
    smooth work flow

4388a76 systemtap: introduce utils variant of systemtap package build

    Variant of systemtap build that compiles and include only very small set
    SystemTap utilities needed on target to compliment SystemTap compiler
    running on host in cross compilation mode.

c4ad1d1 crosstap2: wrapper to build systemtap script on host against given target

    Wrapper script that takes care of assembling all options that need to be passed
    to stap in cross compiled environment case. Note in openembedded-core there
    is crosstap script, but it can build SystemTap script that work with kernel
    only.

d4a6a2a local.conf: add systemtap-utils and dropbear, enable combined debugfs
c50f38c local.conf: switch default MACHINE to qemux86-64

    Set few default to simplify steps description for folks who want to try it out
